# Work Day Scheduler

UCF Module 05 Challenge - Work Day Scheduler

---------------------
## Description

The goal of this challenge, was to build the functionality of a web application.


This web app allows for the tracking of work day tasks. If the tasks are saved, then they will be save into storage so they won't be lost if the page is refreshed. This app also assures that there are no empty or duplicate strings added to storage.


It also gives a visual cue to the user to indicate what time slot they currently are on, to give better focus on what tasks might take priority.
The program for the app will run every hour. This will insure that it maintains a current status.

----------------------
## Getting Started

### User Story
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```


### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
